he website I built is a professional and modern website designed for a university, featuring a user-friendly interface and easy navigation. The website includes a HOME page that provides an overview of the university and its programs, an ABOUT page that describes the university's history, mission, and values, a COURSE page where students can explore the different courses offered, a BLOG page where news and events related to the university are shared, and a CONTACT page that allows visitors to get in touch with the university.

The design of the website is clean, simple, and aesthetically pleasing, with a color scheme that complements the branding of the university. The layout is responsive, ensuring that the website is accessible on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

The HTML and CSS code used to build the website is clean, efficient, and optimized for fast loading times.

Overall, this website provides a comprehensive and engaging online platform for the university, enabling it to connect with students and the wider community in a meaningful way.
